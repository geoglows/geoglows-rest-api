      parameters:
        - name: reach_id

          description: The unique identifier for the stream reach of interest. Also referred to as common identifier (COMID). Requires previous knowledge of the value. This parameter overrides values for `lat` and `lon`

        - name: lat
          in: query
          description: A given latitude used to find the closest stream reach. Must be used together with `lon`. The spatial query uses the center point of the stream reach to determine proximity. This parameter gets superceded by`reach_id`. A lat/lon spatial query will take longer than providing the reach_id. It is recommended that the reach_id be used instead once it is known.
